# International students in Ukraine need more help as Russian intensifies attack


**Ukraine Crisis**  
- Russia invaded Ukraine in Feb. 2022
- The UN estimates find at least 2 million people are displaced inside Ukraine, and more than 2.5 million refugees are sheltering in neighboring countries such as Poland and Mordova
There are also international students displaced and struggling, and one Indian medical student was killed by Russian shelling as a result
- Ukraine has been an attractive destination for many international students 
- Most foreign students in Ukraine are not even from its neighborhood. Most of them are from Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, which made it more difficult for them to escape from Ukraine
